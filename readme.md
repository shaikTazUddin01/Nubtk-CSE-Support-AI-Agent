### Project Title
NUBTK CSE Student Support AI Agent

### Project Duration : 4 Weeks

### Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design and develop an AI-based Student Support System for the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at NUBTK.  
The system will assist students by answering academic-related queries such as course information, class routines, semester details, and general academic guidelines using Artificial Intelligence.

## Week 1: Requirement Analysis & Frontend Setup

### Tasks
- Requirement analysis and problem understanding
- System architecture design (Frontend, AI agent, datastore)
- Selection of technologies (React, Tailwind CSS, n8n)
- Setup React project using Vite
- Configure Tailwind CSS for UI styling
- Design and implement a basic Chat Interface
- Setup n8n environment
- Create a basic Webhook API endpoint in n8n

### Outcome
- Clear understanding of system requirements
- Project folder structure finalized
- Basic frontend chat UI ready
- Webhook endpoint successfully receiving requests

## Week 2: AI Agent Integration (Gemini API)

### Tasks
- Collect and configure Google Gemini API key
- Integrate Gemini API with n8n using HTTP Request node
- Design AI prompt focused on CSE student support
- Enable Bangla language support in AI responses
- Connect frontend with n8n webhook
- Display AI-generated responses in the frontend

### Outcome
- AI agent successfully responding to user queries
- Complete communication pipeline established  
  (React → n8n → Gemini API → React)

---

## Week 3: Data Storage & Conversation Memory

### Tasks
- Design data storage structure for user information and chat history
- Configure Google Drive OAuth in n8n
- Use Google Drive as a datastore for:
  - User profile data
  - Conversation memory (JSON format)
- Implement session-based chat history storage
- Provide previous conversation context to the AI agent

### Outcome
- Persistent conversation memory implemented
- AI agent capable of context-aware responses
- User data and chat sessions stored securely in Google Drive

---

## Week 4: Testing, Security & Deployment

### Tasks
- System testing (frontend, webhook, AI response accuracy)
- Error handling and performance improvements
- Secure webhook access and API key protection
- UI improvements (loading indicators, error messages)
- Final deployment of frontend and n8n workflow
- Prepare complete project documentation (README.md)

### Outcome
- Fully functional AI Student Support System
- Production-ready application
- Project ready for final submission and demonstration

---

## Final Deliverables
- React + Tailwind based web application
- n8n workflow with Gemini AI integration
- Google Drive based data storage system
- Complete project documentation (README.md)
- Deployed and executable system

---

## Conclusion
This four-week project plan ensures the structured development of an AI-based Student Support System.  
The project combines modern web technologies and AI integration to provide a practical and scalable academic support solution for CSE students.
